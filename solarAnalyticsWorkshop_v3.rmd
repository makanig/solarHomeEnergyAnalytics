## Introduction to time series analysis

Time series analysis is commonly used in many fields of science, such as economics, finance, physics, engineering, and astronomy.  The usage of time series analysis to understand past events and to predict future ones did not start with the introduction of the stochastic process during the past century. Ancient civilizations such as the Greeks, Romans, or Mayans, researched and learned how to utilize cycled events such as weather and astronomy to predict future events. 


**Time series analysis** - is the art of extracting meaningful insights from time-series data to learn about past events and to predict future events. 

This process includes the following steps:

* **Data collection** - pulling the raw data from a database, API, flat files etc.
* **Data prep** - cleaning, reformating (dates, classes, etc.), aggregating
* **Descriptive analysis** - using statistical methods and data visualization tools to extract insights and learn about the series components and patterns
* **Predictive analysis** - leveraging the insights learned in the descriptive process and apply some predictive model 

### Typical Time series in R
A typical analysis in R process will look like this (picture credit:Rami & Danton):

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="850px"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste(image_path ,"/Time Series Analysis Workflow.png", sep = ""))
```

### Time series objects

There are multiple classes in R for time-series data, the most common types are:

* The `ts` class for regular time-series data, and `mts` class for multiple time seires objects , the most common class for time series data
* The `xts` and `zoo` classes for both regular and irregular time series data, mainly popular in the financial field
* The `tsibble` class, a tidy format for time series data, support both regular and irregular time-series data





### The TSstudio package

The [TSstudio](https://github.com/RamiKrispin/TSstudio) package provides a set of functions for time series analysis. That includes interactive data visualization tools based on the [plotly](https://plot.ly/r/) package engine, supporting multiple time series objects such as `ts`, `xts`, and `zoo`. The following diagram demonstrates the workflow of the **TSstudio** package:


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="850px"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste(image_path ,"/TSstudio Structure.png", sep = ""))
```


### Time series data

**Time series data** - is a sequence of values, each associate to a unique point in time that can divide to the following two groups:

* **Regular time series** - is a sequence of observations which were captured at equally spaced time intervals (e.g., every month, week, day, hour, etc.)
* **Irregular time series** - or unevenly spaced time series, is a sequence of observations which were not captured on equally spaced time intervals (for example rainy days, earthquakes, clinical trials, etc.)



**Note:** typically, the term time series data referred to regular time-series data. Therefore, if not stated otherwise, throughout the workshop the term time series (or series) refer to regular time-series data

### Applications

With time series analysis, you can answer questions such as:

* How many vehicles, **approximately**, going to be sold in the US in the next 12 months?
* What will be the **estimated** demand for natural gas in the US in the next five years?
* **Generally**, what will be the demand for electricity in the UK during the next 24 hours?

## Solar Generation Forecast Analysis

### What is Solar Net Energy Metering (NEM)
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="850px"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste(image_path ,"/SolarNEM.png", sep = ""))
```

### What can you expect from your online PG&E Analytics
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="850px"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste(image_path ,"/PGE_OnlineAnalytics.png", sep = ""))
```

### Solar Forecast Analysis workflow
This builds on what you saw in the previous Time Series Analysis workflow slide with model comparison and financial sensitivity analysis

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="850px"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste(image_path ,"/AnalysisWorkflow.png", sep = ""))
```

### Our solar generation is an examples of time series data

```{r second_config_chunk}
```

### Every Data Science project needs to fix missing/bad data

* Let's review the code and algorithm that's going into imputing missing/wrong values
```{r third_config_chunk}
```


### ARIMA parameter analysis

* We will skip this (refer to Rami Krispin's workshop for further details)
* These plots are used to arrive at the ARIMA (2,1,1)(0,1,0) parameters
```{r fourth_config_chunk}
```



### GLM models & Training & Test sets

```{r fifth_config_chunk}
```



### Decomposition of GLM model into constituents

* This type of analysis is used in [SalesForce Einstein](https://www.salesforce.com/products/einstein/overview/) and similar tools
* Understand the underlying factors for variance so you can act on it


```{r sixth_config_chunk}
```

### Compare models using training and test sets


```{r seventh_config_chunk}
```

### 25 year ARIMA forecast


```{r eighth_config_chunk}
```


## Financial analysis 

### ROI & IRR

* How do you compare differing investment returns ?

```{r ninth_config_chunk}
```

### Summary of Generation, Usage and NEM

```{r tenth_config_chunk}
